## Before 0.1.0

- `fonts` setting. Katex should put files into the fonts array

## Roadmap

- Support pretty output: Put files in filename/index.html
- Footnotes
- Image resize support
- Add Epub and Mobi (with XHTML serialization with xmlserializer)
- Referencing a figure? Numbering figures?
- Make sectionify more forgiving: No need for directly nested sections?
