## Before 0.1.0

- remove filename numbers
- make tests to check that stylesheets, javascripts, image, and toc respects subfolders in output
- Write note about ordering
- FIX TOC: Insert TOC as the last thing. How?
- Add next/prev functionality
- `fonts` setting
- katex should move fonts into destination. Test on example folder.

## Roadmap

- Support pretty output: Put files in filename/index.html
- Footnotes
- Image resize support
- Add Epub and Mobi (with XHTML serialization with xmlserializer)
- Referencing a figure? Numbering figures?
- Make sectionify more forgiving: No need for directly nested sections?
