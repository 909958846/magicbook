## Roadmap

- Rewrite the plugin README to say how order comes from the .after and .before
- Add list of plugin labels to the README
- Each plugin that requires the extra liquid step should add something to each file, and then the replacement should happen as a final step in the liquid plugin.
- disablePlugins should add disable flag, not remove from array.

- Ability to inline base64 SVG images
- Support pretty output: Put files in filename/index.html
- Footnotes
- Image resize support
- Add Epub and Mobi (with XHTML serialization with xmlserializer)
- Referencing a figure? Numbering figures?
- Make sectionify more forgiving: No need for directly nested sections?
