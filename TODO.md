## Roadmap

- Ability to inline base64 SVG images
- Support pretty output: Put files in filename/index.html
- Footnotes
- Image resize support
- Add Epub and Mobi (with XHTML serialization with xmlserializer)
- Referencing a figure? Numbering figures?
- Make sectionify more forgiving: No need for directly nested sections?
- Right now each plugin does the extra liquid placeholder step. Should we do this once at finish?
