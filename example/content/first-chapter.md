# Markdown chapter

This is a chapter written in markdown.

Code examples can be written using the markdown syntax, and they
will automatically be converted to HTMLBook programlistings. Here's an
example of using the `console.log` function.

```js
console.log("hello");
```

You can reference other files simply by making an internal [link](#second-chapter-id). The build process will automatically search for this ID in all files, and append the filename if needed for the particular format.
